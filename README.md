## Air Quality Analysis Project

## Objective
This project aims to provide valuable insights into the Air Quality of different regions across the globe, allowing researchers and policymakers to make informed decisions on how to address the issue of air pollution.

## Data Collection
The dataset is collected from the kaggle website 'World Air Quality Index by City and Coordinates'.It considers four major air pollutants namely Carbon monoxide, Nitrogen dioxide,Ozone and PM2.5 which are used to calculate the Air Quality Index of a particular region.
